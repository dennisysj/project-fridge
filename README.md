Project will be used for monitoring food spoilage times and best before dates. 

Will notify user when it approaches a perishibles expiry.

*Technology used*

Will use api calls to ai models that creates an agent to analyze recipets that users will upload.

OCR is used to extract text from the receipts and the ai agent will pick out and identify what the food products are, this reduces overall processing time.

The hopes is that I can get the ai to predict the expiration dates as a default placeholder for each product, and if they are approximatly the same dates as the real life products, I'd consider that a successful prediction(maximum error amount of 2-3 days)

Currently a work in progress

Planning to Implement OCR to reduce token count, and increase acuraccy
